# reinerhuechting-courses

Repos related to my courses at DHBW Mannheim. These are mainly programming courses for students of electrical engineering and business information systems. The courses are given in German and thus, the explanations in the repos are also in German.

This organization is for the Development of my teaching material. These repos contain tasks, examples, slides etc. that I use in various courses. However, they are not meant to be used directly in courses. Instead, I will create copies of these repos or select content from them for each course I teach.
